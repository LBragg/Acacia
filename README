SOFTWARE Acacia

SOFTWARE 1.53-b0 (Release 1.53)



Software by Lauren Bragg and Glenn Stone 2010-2014

Contact: lauren.bragg@csiro.au



INSTALLATION NOTES

See associated documentation for running this program.

This release consists of feature improvement and bug fixes (sorry -- no Ion Torrent correction yet, their new BAM format has some issues).


NEW FEATURES

#1 Can now perform hexamer clustering in Acacia without correction (using the "CLUSTER_ONLY=TRUE" flag). This allows you to run Acacia on each cluster separately, minimising the
maximum memory required and allowing the processing to be distributed across threads and/or cluster nodes. If you need help distributing your run across threads, please contact Lauren.


BUG FIXES

#1 Acacia can now use input files larger than 2GB (thanks for spotting this, Henning Seedorf).

#2 Addressed Bug (GitHub #3) -- buttons truncated in GUI




KNOWN ISSUES (that will be addressed in a future release)

#1 Not all parameters are available through the GUI interface, this will be amended in future versions of Acacia
